<h1>My Pets</h1>
 <!--added h4 tag around line 12 to make it it's own summary -->  
<h4>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</h4>

<p>Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.</p>

<h3>Fish</h3>
<!-- line 30 paragraph tag was added to create it's won section-->
<p>Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
